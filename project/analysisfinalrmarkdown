## Overview

The overall aim behind this report is to provide a comprehensive picture of the positive correlation between **SOCIO-ECONOMIC DISPARITIES** and global **HEALTH INDICATORS**. 

As an essential metric commonly utilised towards evaluating global health trends, the **Body Mass Index (BMI)** levels within various regions and selected countries will be analysed. In evaluating BMI as a health indicator, it is generally acknowledged that **LOW LEVELS** of under 18.5 care classified as **UNDERWEIGHT**, whilst a rate of over 30 is considered **OBESITY**. Throughout this analysis, examples of both ends of the spectrum, heightened and decreased rates, will be provided within various different areas. Upon the conclusion of the report, a thorough understanding aims to be received, centred around offering confirmation to the general perception that countries of which suffer more severely with either **low or high rates** are more negatively impacted by socioeconomic factors, with this report applying both  **GDP PER CAPITA** and **LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH** to support this viewpoint.



## WORLD MAP: Global BMI Rates in the Available Countries Between 1987 and 2020


```{r}
#| fig-cap: "This global map provides a detailed observation of the average BMI rates in the available countries between 1987 and 2020. Through providing this early introduction, we can identify the countries where the rates are higher than the expected average, such as Tunisia, Mongolia and Argentina and also worryingly low trends, as seen in Guinea and Niger.Both cases represent an immediate cause for conern."

map_world <- map_data("world")

map_data_join <- full_join(

## Time Series Chart: Evolution of BMI Trends in Selected Countries Between 1987 and 2020


```{r}
#| fig-cap: "The time series chart provides a more focus overview on the evolution of BMI rates between 1987 and 2020. Three countries are selected from each continent to enable a comparison between the trends across different continents. The graph highlights a positive correlation between the years in which the rates both spike and decrease, portraying the global pattern of BMI trends between regions over this period."

## Bar Chart: Comparison Between Males and Females in the Five Most Severely Impacted Countries in 2018


```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Direct focus is placed on one of the most prominent years, 2018, and a comparison between males and females in the five worst performing countries over this period. Through analysins this trend, it can be concluded that whilst males are slightly more affected with low and high levelsl of BMI in the respective countries, the rates are generally equally spread between males and females."

## Scatter Plot: Overall Outcome of BMI Trends on Socio-Economic Factors Between 2013 and 2020


```{r}
#| fig-cap: "The final stage of this report involves analysing the wider impact of the levels of BMI on socioeconomic factors such as GDP per capita and overall life expectancy. The trend confirms the overall global perception that countries suffering more seveerely from high and low levels of BMI face more severe socioeconomic factors, in this case high levels of GDP per capita and lower life expectancy"

## Conclusion & Reccomendations

Overall, this analysis confirms the **positive correlation** between **socio-economic** factors and a **countries overall health** throughout the world. Through mapping these trends, whilst we have witnessed an overall **equal spread between males and females**, we have identified that areas and regions suffering from both **low and high levels** of BMI have **higher levels of GDP per capita** and **lower levels of life expectancy**. As a result of this data, we can conclude on the **urgent need** for **increased policies, assistance and aid** to these particular areas. In doing so, the incentive should be to **transform** these trends and create **healthier living standards and populations**.
